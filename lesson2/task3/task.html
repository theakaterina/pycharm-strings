Oh no! Someone has transcribed the comic
<a href="http://www.qwantz.com/index.php?comic=2406">here</a> incorrectly. The case of the letters is all
wrong. <br><br>Luckily we don't have to fix it by hand, python has built in functions to help us. Your options are <br><br>
string.<b>upper()</b> - turns all letters to uppercase<br>
string.<b>lower()</b> - turns all letters to lowercase<br>
string.<b>capitalize()</b> - capitalizes the first letter of the string<br>
string.<b>title()</b> - capitalizes the first letter of every word in the string (ie. every letter after a space
or punctuation mark)<br>
string.<b>swapcase()</b> - every lowercase letter becomes uppercase and vice-versa<br>
<br>
Your job is to make the output match the comic - change all of t-rex's lines to have to correct case.<br><br>
In case you can't see the comic, it looks like this: <br>
t_rex1 = In today's society, knowing a little about computers can go a long way! <br>
t_rex2 = They're not magic boxes. In fact, the more you learn about them the less magical they'll be! <br>
t_rex3 = Soon you'll be staring at an obscure compiler error and no magic will be left in the world! <br>
t_rex4 = I thought I'd actually start with logic gates, and build up to simple machine languages from that? <br>
t_rex5 = NO, DON'T SAY THAT!

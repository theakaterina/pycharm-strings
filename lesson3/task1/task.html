Splitting is used for when you want to separate a string into a list of multiple strings.<br>
string.split("chars") splits the string every time it gets to "chars".<br><br>
It also removes the "chars" the string.<br>

party = "cake, balloons, presents"<br>
party.split(", ") = ["cake", "balloons", "presents"] <br><br>

quote = "I love lamp"<br>
quote.split(" ") = ["I", "love", "lamp"]<br><br>

string = "what0should0I0do0?"<br>
string.split("0") = ["what", "should", "I", "do", "?"]<br><br>

Provided is a list of websites. Extract the names of the websites (eg. for "google.com" I want you to return
"google") to return a list of the most popular companies on the web. You will need to use split() and splicing
to remove the last entry.

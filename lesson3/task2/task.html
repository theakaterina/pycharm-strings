"chars".join(string or list) allows you to join together letters or items in a list, putting "chars" in between
each one <br> <br>
For example:<br>
word = "hello" <br>
"*".<b>join</b>(word) = "h*e*l*l*o" <br><br>

list = ["lion", "tigers", "bears"]<br>
" and ".<b>join</b>(list) = "lion and tigers and bears"<br><br>

Using the list of companies we generated before, create the sentence: <br>
"The most popular websites are google, facebook, youtube, amazon, twitter, ebay, reddit"<br>
using join and concatenation.

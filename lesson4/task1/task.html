This lesson is all about Booleans. Functions that when applied to strings return either True or False. <br>
First up we have startswith and endswith. <br>
<br>
word = "treasure"<br>
word.<b>startswith</b>("t") = True <br>
word.<b>startswith</b>("tre") = True <br>
word.<b>endswith</b>("E") = False <br>
<br>
Define a function that takes a list of words and returns the ones that start with a certain letter.
